# Compiler
Overview
This project involves the development of a mini compiler using C++. The compiler is designed to translate high-level language code into machine code, implementing key components such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code generation.

Features
Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code, identifying keywords, operators, identifiers, literals, and other tokens.
Syntax Analysis: Constructs a parse tree from the tokenized input, ensuring the source code adheres to the grammar rules of the language.
Code Generation: Converts the parse tree into machine code or an intermediate representation.
